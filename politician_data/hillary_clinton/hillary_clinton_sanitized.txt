clinton reportedly played a key role in persuading obama to militarily intervene in libya during the libyan civil war and deemed it worthwhile to intervene due to fears of further atrocities by libyan dictator muammar gaddafi a unified europeanarab front in favor of intervention and a belief that the libyan opposition could govern in the aftermath of an intervention after the conclusion of the libyan civil war and the demise of gaddafi there remained factional violence in libya until it erupted into renewed civil war in terrorist groups have taken refuge in libya and large numbers of refugees have fled to neighboring countries and across the mediterranean when asked to defend her record on libya clinton called it a classic case of a hard choice and found that the overthrow of gaddafi represented smart power at its bestclinton has said that historys judgment on the intervention and her role in it are not yet final in november she said to the council on foreign relations that the libyan people have voted twice in free and fair elections for the kind of leadership they want they have not been able to figure out how to prevent the disruptions that they are confronted with because of internal divides and because of some of the external pressures that are coming from terrorist groups and others so i think its too soon to tell and i think its something that we have to be you know looking at very closely
on october clinton voted in favor of the authorization for use of military force against iraq commonly known as the iraq war resolution to give president bush authority for the iraq war in an interview on december she expressed regret for the vote obviously if we knew then what we know now there wouldnt have been a vote and i certainly wouldnt have voted for it by february clinton failed to state that her vote was a mistake or to apologize for it as antiwar democrats demanded if the most important thing to any of you is choosing someone who did not cast that vote or has said his vote was a mistake then there are others to choose from clinton told an audience in dover new hampshirein the second democratic debate of the presidential race clinton said that she voted for the resolution under the impression that bush would allow more time for un inspectors to find proof of weapons of mass destruction before proceeding reporter carl bernstein and others have questioned why clinton would have voted against the levin amendment which would have required president bush to allow more time to un weapons inspectors and also would have required a separate congressional authorization to allow a unilateral invasion of iraq if her vote was simply a vote for strong diplomacyduring an april interview on larry king live clinton was asked about her october vote in favor of the iraq war resolutionobviously ive thought about that a lot in the months since no i dont regret giving the president authority because at the time it was in the context of weapons of mass destruction grave threats to the united states and clearly saddam hussein had been a real problem for the international community for more than a decade the consensus was the same from the clinton administration to the bush administration it was the same intelligence belief that our allies and friends around the world sharedbut she said the bush administration really believed it they really thought they were right but they didnt let enough sunlight into their thinking process to really have the kind of debate that needs to take place when a serious decision occurs like thatin a november letter to her constituents senator clinton said there are no quick and easy solutions to the long and drawn out conflict the bush administration triggered i do not believe that we should allow this to be an openended commitment without limits or end nor do i believe that we can or should pull out of iraq immediatelyon june clinton said of the us airstrike that killed abu musab alzarqawi i saw firsthand the terrible consequences of zarqawis terrorist network when bill chelsea and i visited the hotel ballroom in amman jordan last november where zarqawis followers had detonated a bomb at a wedding killing and wounding innocent people we owe our thanks to our men and women in uniform and others in iraq who have been fighting zarqawi and other insurgents and who are responsible for todays successin a speech on june clinton sharply criticized president george w bushs handling of the iraq war saying that bush rushed to war and refused to let the un inspectors conduct and complete their mission we need to be building alliances instead of isolation around the world there must be a plan that will begin to bring our troops home in the same speech however clinton reiterated her longstanding opposition to a timeline for us withdrawal saying i do not think it is a smart strategy either for the president to continue with his openended commitment which i think does not put enough pressure on the iraqi government nor do i think it is a smart policy to set a date certainclinton opposed the iraq war troop surge of and supported a february nonbinding senate resolution against it which failed to gain cloture on february clinton said believe me i understand the frustration and the outrage you have to have votes to cap troops to limit funding to do anything if we in congress dont end this war before january as president i will on february hillary clinton announced the iraq troop protection and reduction act of this act would compel president bush to begin relegating troops from iraq within days of remote passage or according to clinton congress would have to dismantle their authorization for the war the act would also end the blank check to the iraqi government and submit them to harsh consequences if boundaries are violated lastly the act would require the secretary of defense to verify the condition in terms of supplies and in terms of their training of all iraqi troops before they are sentin march she voted in favor of a war spending bill that required president bush to begin withdrawing troops from iraq within a certain deadline it passed almost completely along party lines but was subsequently vetoed by president bushin may clinton was one of only senators to vote against a compromise war funding bill that removed previously vetoed withdrawal deadlines but tied funding to progress benchmarks for the iraqi government she said i fully support our troops but this measure fails to compel the president to give our troops a new strategy in iraqwhile calling for ending the war in iraq clintons indicated in july that she advocates keeping a reduced number of us troops in iraq for the foreseeable future stating we cannot lose sight of our very real strategic national interests in this region in the speech she posited redeploying us forces to protect the kurdish region in the north to engage in targeted operations against alqaeda in iraq and to train and equip iraqi forces clintons position is similar to that of the iraq study group in that she highlights the need for political reconciliation in iraq supports the withdrawal of us combat brigades and favors keeping a reduced number of troops to serve in training and support roles such as protection of the us embassyon august clinton credited the troop surge and related new tactics with helping to produce the anbar awakening in al anbar governorate but said that overall the increase in troops had not met stated goals the surge was designed to give the iraqi government time to take steps to ensure a political solution it has failed furthermore clinton following the lead of senate armed services committee chair carl levin called on the iraqi parliament to replace nouri almaliki as prime minister of iraq with a less divisive and more unifying figure saying that maliki had failed to make progress in bridging differences between the hostile factions within iraq iraqi leaders have not met their own political benchmarks to share power modify the debaathification laws pass an oil law schedule provincial elections and amend their constitution four days later maliki responded angrily to the suggestion saying there are american officials who consider iraq as if it were one of their villages for example hillary clinton and carl levin this is severe interference in our domestic affairs carl levin and hillary clinton are from the democratic party and they must demonstrate democracy i ask them to come to their senses and to talk in a respectful way about iraqin an open letter to president bush dated november clinton stated the president must make it crystal clear that the united states will not maintain permanent bases in iraq they would damage us interests in iraq and the broader region and i will continue to strongly oppose themby late november with still more evidence that the surge and other tactics and developments had led to a significant lessening of the civil violence in iraq clinton acknowledged the successes but said that the underlying equation had not changed our troops are the best in the world if you increase their numbers they are going to make a difference the fundamental point here is that the purpose of the surge was to create space for political reconciliation and that has not happened and there is no indication that it is going to happen or that the iraqis will meet the political benchmarks we need to stop refereeing their civil war and start getting out of itat the january democratic debate in las vegas clinton along with senators barack obama and john edwards maintained that they cannot guarantee the removal of all us troops by the end of their first presidential term due to continuing support roles all three pledged to begin the withdrawal of combat brigades within days of taking office additionally clinton used the opportunity to ask senator obama to cosponsor legislation to prevent president bush from signing longterm agreements with the government of iraq without the express consent of congress stating so ive introduced legislation that clearly requires president bush to come to the united states congress it is not enough as he claims to go to the iraqi parliament but to come to the united states congress to get anything that hes trying to do including permanent bases numbers of troops all the other commitments hes talking about as hes traveling in that region

thensenator clinton said that she opposed allowing samesex marriage while affirming her support for some form of civil unions for samesex couples i think that the vast majority of americans find samesex marriage to be something they cant agree with but i think most americans are fair and if they believe that people in committed relationships want to share their lives and not only that have the same rights that i do in my marriage to decide who i want to inherit my property or visit me in a hospital i think that most americans would think that thats fair and that should be donein the same interview with roberts clinton expressed opposition to the federal marriage amendment a proposed constitutional amendment to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman and thereby ban samesex marriage i think that would be a terrible step backwards it would be the first time weve ever amended the constitution to deny rights to people and i think that should be left to the states you know i find it hard to believe in one program health care im agreeing with newt gingrich now im about to agree with dick cheney but i think vice president cheneys position on gay marriage is the right onein in a speech she made on the floor of the senate on the subject clinton said i believe marriage is not just a bond but a sacred bond between a man and a woman i have had occasion in my life to defend marriage to stand up for marriage to believe in the hard work and challenge of marriage so i take umbrage at anyone who might suggest that those of us who worry about amending the constitution are less committed to the sanctity of marriage or to the fundamental bedrock principle that it exists between a man and a woman going back into the midst of history as one of the founding foundational institutions of history and humanity and civilization and that its primary principal role during those millennia has been the raising and socializing of children for the society into
