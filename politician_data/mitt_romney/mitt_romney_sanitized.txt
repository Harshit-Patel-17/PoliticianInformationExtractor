than obamas policieswhile campaigning for the governorship of massachusetts in romney argued that the federal government should pay for medicines for seniors it is outrageous that some senior citizens are forced to choose between paying for their prescription drugs and their groceries the federal government needs to step in with a plan for our senior citizens and i will lobby officials on the

the detroit economic club during which he discussed his recently unveiled economic plan and federal budget proposal romney said that to help control government healthcare expenditures as president he

august a year earlier in june the republicancontrolled us house of representatives had passed a republican alternative budget proposed by ryan with no democrats voting for it one controversial aspect of the proposal concerned medicare for those under age as of its enactment it would replace the existing medicare system in which the government pays doctors hospitals and other medical providers fees for services rendered with a system in which the government would instead pay vouchers also referred to as premiumsupport subsidies to medicare beneficiaries who could then use their vouchers to either buy private medical insurance or to obtain coverage in a plan similar to traditional medicare romney said that as president he would sign such a plan if it reached his desk but he added that he would be putting forward his own plan before debating obamaduring an interview in august several days after choosing ryan as his running mate romney said paul ryan and my plan for medicare i think is the same if not identical its probably close to identicala study by the kaiser family foundation said in october that a hypothetical medicare plan along the lines of romney would raise premiums for

renewable energy and that i think the global warming debate is now pretty much over and people recognize the need associated with providing sources which do not generate the heat currently provided by fossil fuelscampaigning for the governorship he argued in support of measures such as imposing higher taxes on suvs to help reduce auto emissions and conserve energy revitalizing urban neighborhoods using fees charged to developers for cutting down trees in suburban areas and doubling the rate of cleanup of brownfield landsin his first days in office as governor he proposed expansion of the beverage container deposit law bottle bill a switch by state government agencies to the use of environmentally friendly cleansers and clean up of the states filthy five power plants he appointed a prominent environmentalist douglas foy to oversee energy development transportation housing and environmental affairs foy helped develop an energy and environment plan that included public and private initiatives with a goal of deriving percent of the states electricity from renewable sources such as wind solar and nonpolluting fuel cells by and of reducing greenhouse gas emissions of state agencies by percent the plan also proposed to impose strict emissions standards on older power plants and sought to substantially reduce soot emissions from diesel buses trucks and heavy construction equipmentarguing for environmental protection regulations in romney said that if the choice is between dirty power plants or protecting the health of the people of massachusetts i will always come down on the side of public health he insisted that a coal power plant not delay in meeting tough emissions standards even at the cost of losing jobs i will not create jobs or hold jobs that kill people and that plant that plant kills peopleas governor he also argued for limits on oil and gas drilling in order to protect the environment in his state of the commonwealth address in january

for grabs like some wild west land rush he signed into law a bill to protect against oil spills and to increase penalties for pollutershe pursued policies to make greater use of carpooling and public transit and sought tax credits to stimulate purchases of hybrid and other more fuelefficient vehiclesromney argued that tax policy should be used to promote energy conservation when his lieutenant governor supported a temporary suspension of the state gasoline tax to provide consumers some relief during a period of especially high gasoline prices in romney rejected the proposal arguing that maintaining the tax would help encourage energy conservation i dont think that now is the time and im not sure there will be the right time for us to encourage the use of more gasoline i am very much in favor of people recognizing that these high gasoline prices are probably here to stay and that the appropriate action for us to take is to find ways to find fuel conservationhe highlighted support for government investment in developing sources of renewable energy such as wind and solar early in his administration although he opposed a proposal that would have sited a wind farm in nantucket sound off cape cod where he said the visual impact would be detrimental to the states tourist economyromney initially supported a regional greenhouse gas capandtrade initiative for new england and eastern canada but he ultimately withdrew his support when he was unable to ensure establishment of certain limits on the penalty fees businesses would be charged for exceeding emissions allowances a week later his administration issued a rule allowing companies to pay a fine instead of having to clean up emissions of toxins like mercury both decisions were made as romney announced he would not run for a second term as governor and began to focus on entering the presidential campaign some former romney policy advisors later told the new york times that his political team had been afraid that with industry being opposed to the capandtrade proposal romneys having included massachusetts in the regional greenhouse gas initiative would have made romneys chance of winning a presidential campaign very unlikelyearly in the presidential campaign in june romney said i dont speak for the scientific community of course but i believe the worlds getting warmer i cant prove that but i believe based on what i read that the world is getting warmer and number two i believe that humans contribute to that i dont know how much our contribution is to that because i know that there have been periods of greater heat and warmth in the past but i believe we contribute to that and so i think its important for us to reduce our emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases that may well be significant contributors to the climate change and the global warming that youre seeing several weeks later in october he said my view is that we dont know whats causing climate change on this planet and the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce co emissions is not the right course for us he expressed his opposition to cap and trade plans and to regulation of carbon emissions in june romneys domestic policy advisor oren cass told the los angeles times hes a supporter of renewable energy as long as its anything that would be economically competitive he doesnt know the extent to which climate change is occurring or that human activity is causing it what you wont see are mandates or taxes or regulations that interfere with economic activityin august during a week of heavy fundraising from oil company executives romney put forward what he called a comprehensive energy plan that he said would allow north america to become independent of foreign oil imports within a decaderomneys energy proposal called for aggressively expanding drilling for fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas by easing federal regulations the plan would seek to increase offshore drilling along the coasts of states like virginia and the carolinas as well as in previously restricted areas of the arctic national wildlife refuge and would give states more control over energy

access to contraceptives and the presidents statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong

his sons keeps two guns at the family vacation home in utahin december still campaigning for the republican presidential nomination romney summed up his general position on gun control at that time as we should check on the backgrounds of people who are trying to purchase guns we also should keep weapons of unusual lethality from being on the street and finally we should go after people who use guns in the commission of crimes or illegally but we should not interfere with the right of lawabiding citizens to own guns either for their own personal protection or hunting or any other lawful purpose he also said that had it come before him as president he would have signed a renewal of the federal assault weapons ban that had expired the following month during a presidential primary
